Scheme is a minimalist, yet powerful, programming language in the Lisp family. Developed in the late 1970s, Scheme has influenced the design of many other programming languages and is known for its simplicity, elegance, and expressive power. 
Here's a brief presentation of Scheme and some of its most important features:

1. **Simplicity and Elegance:**
   - Scheme is designed with a minimalistic philosophy. It has a small, consistent syntax, making it easy to learn and read. The language encourages simplicity and clarity in code.

2. **Functional Programming:**
   - Scheme is a functional programming language, treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Functions are first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as results.

3. **Lexical (static) Scoping:**
   - Scheme uses lexical scoping, where the scope of a variable is determined by its location in the source code. This allows for clear and predictable scoping behavior.

4. **Tail Call Optimization:**
   - Scheme supports tail call optimization, an important feature for recursion-heavy code. This optimization allows tail-recursive functions to be executed efficiently without consuming additional stack space.

5. **Dynamic Typing:**
   - Scheme is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are checked at runtime. This provides flexibility but requires careful consideration of data types in the code.

6. **Garbage Collection:**
   - Scheme has automatic garbage collection, relieving the programmer from manual memory management. This enhances productivity and reduces the likelihood of memory-related errors.

7. **Wide use of Macros:**
   - Scheme is known for its powerful macro system, which allows users to define new syntactic constructs. Macros enable the creation of domain-specific languages and facilitate code abstraction and reuse.

10. **Built-in support for Continuations:**
    - Scheme features first-class continuations, allowing sophisticated control flow constructs and enabling the implementation of advanced programming paradigms, such as coroutines and backtracking.

While Scheme may not be as widely used as some other languages in industry applications, its influence can be seen in various fields, including academic research, language design, and the development of other Lisp-based languages. The language continues to be a source of inspiration for its elegant design and powerful features.

This repository hosts some simple exercises and solutions that can be used to get accustomed to this language and its syntax. 
It has to be mentioned the fact that the **Racket** dialect of Scheme is actually employed to solve these coding challenges.
